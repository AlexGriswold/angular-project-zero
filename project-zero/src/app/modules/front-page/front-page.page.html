    <p>My name is Alex. I'm a Front End Developer. Basically, everything you can see and interact with on the Internet was made by someone like me.</p>
    <p>The point of this website is to show potential employers that I know how to do this job. Feel free to ask me any questions!</p>
    <p>This website was built with Angular 9. It provides an example case for lazy-loading, the router, services, subscriptions with RxJS, API integrations, and data binding.</p>
    <p>Also, please appreciate the pleasing CSS effects. Pretty nice eh?</p> -->
